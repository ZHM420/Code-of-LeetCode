# Code-of-LeetCode #

## Introduction
* In the repository, you could see many .cpp files that are all the solutions for algorithm questions in LeetCode. These solutions are designed for efficiency from the perspective of time complexity.

## Structure
### Method
* Diffirent kinds of feasible solutions are available here. You could try more new ways to solve the same question and come up with your own new method!
### Note
* Here are some valuable points of CS knowledge and conclusion for programming skills.
### Code
* It is the most important part in this file, in which the code could be used directly in LeetCode. If you find anything wrong or not good, you could tell me or change it by yourself at anytime!
